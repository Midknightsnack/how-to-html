## Project Description
This project, How-To-HTML, is a compilation of certain things you can code in HTML. Whether it's making images move or making a login page, it can be coded using HTML. The problem is knowing how to do it, which is where this open source project might come in handy.

## Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (if needed)

## How to Run Code
Running the code is pretty easy. If you're on Visual Studio Code, just write click the file and click "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Other Browsers". 

Optional but Recommended: On Visual Studio Code, there's a useful extension callled Live Server and it's by Ritwick Dey. The extension allows you to make changes to your code while seeing the results of it in real time so you don't have to open and close the html file everytime.

## Other Things to Note
* There are designated areas to work on your issue in index.html. However, you're free to include other files as long as they don't conflict with the main one (index.html).
* If you work on an issue, make sure the things you create are stylized by utilizing styles.css. Change the font or give things a border, but don't just leave it with its default look.
